        <h1 class="heading"> Fluorescence Guided Surgery</h1>

        <p style="font-size: 2rem;">This technique is also part of new emerging intraoperative technologies which help surgeons during the course of the surgery. Fluorescence guided surgery uses a fluorescent substance and a special microscope to see edges of the tumor more sharply.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 2rem;">The substance lights up with a special blue light under the microscope, which helps the neurosurgeon in removing the tumor completely without hurting any surrounding healthy tissue. Studies have shown that tumors can be removed more effectively with this technique when compared with conventional methods.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 2rem;">With the help of real-time visualization of the tumor during the course of the surgery, the precision of the surgery increases significantly and the chances of any injury are lowered.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Applications of this image-guided surgery have evolved over the past several decades and the technique has now become widespread. It can illuminate tissues which may have been difficult to differentiate from its surroundings via other techniques. You can rely on us for the smooth execution of this surgical vision enhancing method.</p>

        <h1 class="heading"> Complex Degenerative Spine Disease</h1>

        <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Complex degenerative spine disease is an umbrella term for various diseases caused by loss of function, mobility or strength of the spine. Often caused by usual deterioration of the spine as we age, these diseases can severely impact your lifestyle or add to pains of other medical conditions.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 2rem;">The complex parts in the spine include joints, bones, nerves, muscles, discs and ligaments. Any disease from stenosis to sciatica or pinched nerves is categorized under this term. Surgery is needed only when non-operative care becomes ineffective.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 2rem;">While it may seem a little overwhelming to opt for a spine surgery, the step may help you to finally get back to a normal life free from the constant pain. The causes may be quite nonspecific and the symptoms could also include weakness, pain and tingling radiating to even your limbs.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 2rem;">We take the time to explain to you different risks, procedures, options and recovery times to help you choose the best treatment. We ensure the right surgery with the use of advanced technology and the latest tools available at our disposal.</p>
